# sales
This data analysis project covers customer demographics, sales trends and product performance for a fictional company over 2010 to 2014 using PostgreSQL.

Based on the data, I found that there was:

- Huge spike in sales in 2013 that is led by bicycle sales
- Seasonal growth in December and June
- Consistently balanced gender mix with a shift towards married customer as the business matures
